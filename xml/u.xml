</meaning>


<meaning>
 on the other hand (especially in connexion with a relative, e.g. {ya u}, he on the contrary who &amp;c.) This particle may serve to give emphasis, like {id} and {eva}, especially after prepositions or demonstrative pronouns, in conjunction with {nu}, {vai}, {hi}, {cid}, &amp;c. (e.g. {ayám u vām purutámo}.. {johaviiti} [RV. iii, 62, 2], this very person {your worshipper} invokes you &amp;c.) It is especially used in the figure of speech called Anaphora, and particularly when the pronouns are repeated (e.g. {tám u stuṣa índram tám gṛṇīṣe} [RV. ii, 20, 4], him I praise, Indra, him I sing). It may be used in drawing a conclusion, like the English 'now' (e.g. {tád u táthā ná kuryāt} [ŚBr. v, 2, 2, 3], that now he should not do in such a manner), and is frequently found in interrogative sentences (e.g. {ká u tác ciketa} [RV. i, 164, 48], who, I ask, should know that?) Pāṇini calls this particle {uñ} to distinguish it from the interrogative {u}. In the Pada-pāṭha it is written {ūm}. In the classical language {u} occurs only after {atha}, {na}, and {kim}, with a slight modification of the sense, and often only as an expletive ( {kim})
