<meaning>

</meaning>


<meaning>
 it contains a number of verses or stanzas nearly all of which {except about 78} occur in the Ṛig-veda and which, modified in various ways, are chanted, mostly, by the Udgātṛi priests at Soma sacrifices 
</meaning>


<meaning>
 the Saṃhitā of the Sāma-veda consists of two parts 
</meaning>


<meaning>
 the first, called Arcika {or Purviccika or Chando-grantha}, contains 585 verses disjoined from their proper sequence in the Ṛig-veda and arranged in 59 Daśatis or decades, which again are subdivided into Prapāṭhakas and Ardha-prapāṭhakas 
</meaning>


<meaning>
 the second, called Uttarârcika or Uttarā-grantha, contains 1225 verses, also chiefly from the Ṛik-saṃhitā, but less disjointed than in the first part, and arranged in nine Prapāhakas with Ardha-prapāṭhakas, mostly, however, grouped in triplets 
</meaning>


<meaning>
 the directions for the formation of Sāmans or chants out of these verses are carefully laid down in the Gānas or manuals for chanting, two of which, viz. the Geya-gāna and Āraṇya-g, are a directory for the Ārcika portion, and two, viz. Ūha-gṭgāna and Ūhya-gāna, for the Uttarârcikā
